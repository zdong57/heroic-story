Once upon a time, in a world with swords and magics, there was a boy who admired heroes.
He was saved from a fire by a no-name.
Since then, becoming a hero has been his only dream.
But unlike his strong will to server justice, he was born with no magic talent.
No matter how hard he tried, he was no match against those who born with superior talents.

However, one day, he saw an advertisement in the paper.
"Heroes wanted," it read.
He picked up the phone and dialed the number in the advertisement.
Was this his one shot to prove himself?
They gave him an interview, but unfortunately
he failed.
